### @ArtPressure_bot
#### <https://t.me/ArtPressure_bot>
-------------
The bot was created when I started my way with python.  
I can see architecture and other limitations in code,
but decided to save it,  
because it provides me an oportunity to measure and assess my progress through time.  

Pressure bot collects arterial pressure data and makes graphs.  
It also reminds when it's time to measure pressure and makes recommendation about health.


## Usage
To use the @ArtPressure_bot you need to install telegram first
and connect to the bot.
A full working example on how is works provided in telegram_pressure_bot.py.
